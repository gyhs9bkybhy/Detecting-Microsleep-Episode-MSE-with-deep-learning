# Detecting-Microsleep-Episode-MSE-with-deep-learning
This is the research project in CS 598 Deep Learning for Healthcare. This project aims at applying deep learning techniques to detecting Microsleep Episode(MSE). Firstly, CNN and CNN-LSTM are reproduced as baseline from Alexander Malafeev, Anneke Hertig-Godeschalk, David R. Schreier, Jelena Skorucak, Johannes Mathis, Peter Achermann. Automatic detection of microsleep episodes with deep learning. Frontiers in Neuroscience. 2021. (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.564098/full). Secondly, LSTM+CRF is implemented to imporve the performance.
